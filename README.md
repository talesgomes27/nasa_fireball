# nasa_fireball
This project was done as the final work of Curso-r's dashboard course, with the objective of recreating NASA's website, which monitors the appearance of fireballs in Earth's airspace, in the shiny framework. For this we used the shinydashboard package and the shinyapps.io service from Rstudio.
